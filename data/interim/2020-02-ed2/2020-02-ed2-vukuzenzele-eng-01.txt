Distributed by:Printed by:GENERALThe DDM was inspired by government’s Khawuleza (hurry up) call to action.
It aims to accelerate, align and integrate service delivery under a single development plan and includes 44 district and eight metropolitan municipalities.
The district plan will ensure that national priorities such as economic growth and employment; improvements to living conditions; the fight against crime and corruption and better education outcomes are attended to in the locality concerned.
This development approach ensures that planning and spending are integrated across the three spheres  of government.The DDM in a nutshell• From page 1The Municipal De marcation Board (MDB) will soon embark on nationwide public consultations on the draft sets of electoral wards in preparation for next year’s local govern ment elections.
Addressing the media recently, MDB board chair person Thabo Manyoni said the consultative process which will be held between February and April this year reflects the board’s com mitment to improve public participation in democratic processes.
“We therefore call on all members of the public to actively participate and express their views on how their wards should be con figured,” said Manyoni.
As one of the core man dates of the organisation, Manyoni said the ward delimitation process is regarded as a crucial step towards deepening local democracy and promot ing spatial transformation within communities.
The ward delimitation process entails the division of the whole geographic area of a municipality into smaller geographic areas, called wards.
The MDB delimits wards for the purpose of local elections after consul tations with the  (IEC).
Wards are delimited in all metropolitan and local mu nicipalities. This process is necessary to lay a solid foundation for the delivery of free and fair local gov ernment elections.
During the 2016 local gov ernment elections, there were 4 392 wards in the country. An additional 76 wards will bring the total number of wards to 4 468 for the 2021 local govern ment elections.
Over the next three months, the MDB will visit all local and metropolitan municipalities across the country for consultations.
In February, the board will be in the Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga, KwaZu lu-Natal and Western Cape. The following month will see the board in Gaut eng. The consultations will conclude in April in the Northern Cape, Free State, North West and Limpopo.
MDB deputy chairperson Mbali Myeni said the final wards will be announced in July.
“We should have the com fort of knowing that the process was transparent and decisions taken have, as far as possible, embraced in puts from our stakeholders and communities,” she said.
The final list of wards will then be handed over to the IEC in August 2020.
Myeni said it is important to indicate that the MDB has no influence in the determi nation of the formulae and the number of councillors in a municipality, and therefore cannot increase or reduce the number of councillors determined by Members of Executive Councils.

She was also shown how to build hydropon ic tunnels, which has stood her in good stead,Tsoabi, who was initially a farmworker, now owns a farm that produces lavender, basil and lemongrass, among other things. She said instead of outsourcing the building of structures at her 2.5-hectare farm in Sebokeng, she works with community members to build them.
“The people I work with sometimes don’t have the skills so I show them how things are done and once we are finished, they use those skills to build houses for others in the com munity,” Tsoabi said.
