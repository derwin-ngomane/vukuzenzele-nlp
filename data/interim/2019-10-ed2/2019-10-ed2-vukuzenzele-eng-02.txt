• From page 1 Participate in Census 2021’s  Mini Test EXPECT A KNOCK on your door from Statistics South Africa’s fieldworkers as they gather information ahead of Census 2021.
More Matshediso Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke is encouraging com munities to participate in Statistics South Africa’s (Stats SA) Census 2021 Mini Test, to ensure that quality data for evidence-based policy-making is collected.
The Mini Test runs from 9 October to 6 November in selected areas around the country.
Fieldworkers have already started visiting households in Buffalo City, Ekurhuleni, Mangaung, UMgungund lovu, Polokwane, Emalahleni, Kimberley, Rustenburg and Cape Town.
“Data collected remains confidential and covers demo graphic variables such as age, sex, language spoken, migration, education, employment status and household living conditions, among others,” said Maluleke.
According to Stats SA, the Census Mini Test is being conducted to prepare for the upcoming Census in 2021. It will test and review census data collection tools, systems and operational methodolo gies.
Stats SA said Census 2021 will be the first population count to use new digital meth ods of data collection.
Fieldworkers will administer the census questionnaire face-to-face with respondents, using a computer-assisted personal interview. Where applicable, a computer-assisted web interview is available to complete the questionnaire online.
“Population censuses are the key source of data about the population and the so-cio-economic dynamics in the country. The data collected through a census is used by different sectors of society, including government, business and other users, for evidence-based planning and decision making,” Maluleke said.
Field operations officers completed training ahead of the Mini Test to prepare them to implement the new methodologies.  Given the continued development of new settlements in the country, Stats SA said updating the geography frame is one of the key activities that guide fieldwork operations to ensure that all dwelling units are identified and recorded. “Fieldworkers assigned to update the geography frame are already working across the country to ensure that a comprehensive list is developed.
They can be identified by their official Stats SA identification card, displaying the Stats SA logo, their photograph and a unique number,” said Stats SA.
Respondents can contact Census 2021’s toll-free number on 0800 110 248 or visit www.statssa.gov.za to verify fieldworkers visiting their homes.
an aircraft engineer in avi onics.
“I was then appointed as an aircraft maintenance en gineer specialising in non-de structive testing inspection,” she said.
As part of her job, she performs detailed inspec tions on aircraft and aircraft components, using various specialised techniques of inspection to look for cracks and defects that are not visible to the naked eye but which could cause damage to or malfunction of the aircraft. Like vehicles, an aircraft needs to be regularly serviced for it to function properly and to transport passengers safely.
“One of the most fulfilling rewards for me is to see an aircraft I have worked on take-off, defect-free, and know that my signature is there among the many talent ed, committed and passion ate men and women who also worked on it,” she said.
“I cannot afford to miss any defects. I have to be at my optimum every day and remind myself that although I work with aircraft, people’s lives are what I have to keep in mind,” she added.
She has to develop herself constantly to stay on par with the rest of the engineers in her field because technology is always evolving.
One of the highlights of her career is recently attending training at Rolls-Royce, which is a British luxury car and aero-engine manufactur -ing business. The company has built a solid reputation for the development and manufacture of engines for defence and civil aircraft.
"According to their records, I am the third female in the world and the first one from Africa to receive this kind of training from their company.
That is really humbling to know,” she said.
Phokwane has encouraged young people to consider this career path because non-destructive testing in spection is not as popular in South Africa as it is abroad, and that means there are job opportunities for qualified individuals.
She said the fact that she is still the only woman at SAA Technical doing this kind of work shows that graduates would be highly employable. Opportunities for young peopleAccording to SAA head of media relations Tlali Tlali, SAA Technical recruits and trains about 150 apprentices and 30 interns annually. "All nine provinces are allocated an appropriate number of recruits to ensure that youth from across the country get equal opportunities to become aircraft artisans," said Tlali. He also said the apprentices and interns get trained as aircraft mechanics and aircraft elec tricians, radiotricians, instru mentation experts, welders, trimmers, spray-painters and structure workers.
Tlali said SAA Technical advertises the internships internally, as well as through all Offices of the Premier and with different training institutions, such as technical and vocational education and training colleges.
The recruitment process for the next intake has closed and interviews are now being con ducted, said Tlali “The first 100 apprentices will start on 16 October, and a second batch of 50 on 16 March 2020. We will not advertise for the March 2020 intake as we have acquired enough CVs for both intakes,” said Tlali.
He added that the 30 interns, who already hold a tertiary qualification, will start on 16 November 2019.
You can visit the Premier’s Office in your province to find out about the next application period for apprentic es and interns.
