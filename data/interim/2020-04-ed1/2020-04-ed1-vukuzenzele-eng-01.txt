Payment of social grantsSocial Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu says all social development, National De velopment Agency offices and South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) pay points will remain op erational.
SASSA has asked benefi ciaries not to collect their grants on the first day of payment, due to high pe destrian traffic at shopping malls and other outlets, and has assured beneficiaries that once money has been paid into their accounts, it can be accessed on any day of the month.
In terms of managing numbers at cash pay points, the organisation together with The South African Post Office will ensure that the number of clients being serviced at a time does not exceed the national set num ber of 100 people.
Priority will be given to the elderly, frail, people with disabilities, mothers with young children, as well as pregnant women.
All staff dealing directly with clients will be sup plied with all the necessary protective kits to ensure that their health is safeguarded.
The department has also suspended all Integrated Community Registration Outreach Programmes and home, clinic and hospital visits by SASSA officials.
Clients are advised not to report to local offices for simple enquiries, but to call SASSA and the South Afri can Post Office on their tollfree customer care numbers or visit their social media channels. For more infor mation, call 0800 601 011.
Price hikes bannedWith many people panic buying over the past few days, shelves in many retailers were emptied of non-perishable foods and other essential items like toi let paper and hand sanitiser, and some shops put their prices up on these items.
