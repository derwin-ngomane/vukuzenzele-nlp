Silusapho NyandaDesmond Mokoe na (28) from Ha zyview in Mpu malanga is delighted that the province finally has its own high court in Mbombela (Nelspruit).
For the past 25 years, Mpumalanga was the only province without a high court.
The nearest high court was in Pretoria, which made ac cess difficult and costly.
“This is a really good thing for the people in the prov ince. This will allow people and those wanting to support them to go to the court. In the past, one of my relatives had an estate-related dispute with her in-laws and we were not able to be there for her as the matter sat in Pretoria,” he said.
Mokoena said having the court in Mpumalanga’s com mercial hub means that peo ple who work in Nelspruit no longer need to miss work to go to court.
 The court was also designed to protect the identities of victims of Gender-Based Violence (GBV), so that they can access the justice system without fear.
Mokoena said that the high rate of GBV and violent crimes in society necessitated having the court nearby to deal with such matters.
“Until now, citizens whose matters fell outside the ju risdiction of the local mag istrate’s courts had to obtain relief in the high court in Pretoria. This caused consid erable inconvenience, delays and financial hardship,” said President Cyril Ramaphosa at the court’s official opening recently.
The court building has 12 courtrooms, including a room specifically for use by special ised high courts such as the Labour Court and the Land Claims Court. The President said the court will also help strengthen the work of the Family Advocate’s Office.  vGENERALTel: 012 473 0089 Email: vukuzenzele@gcis.gov.zaAddress: Private Bag X745,  Pretoria, 0001Head of Editorial and Production  Tasneem Carrim  |  tasneem@gcis.gov.zaEditor-in-ChiefZanele Mngadi | zanelemngadi@gcis.gov.zaManaging EditorOngezwa Mogotsi ongezwa@gcis.gov.zaNews Editor Noluthando Motswai Writers  More Matshediso, Jauhara KhanSilusapho NyandaSenior Designer | Tendai Gonese Junior Designer  | Tsholofelo Sepeng Language Practitioners  Nomgcibelo Motha  Boitumelo PhalatsePhakamani Dadlanais published by Government Communications (GCIS)Vuk’uzenzeleAll rights reserved.

Printed by:Mpumalanga gets its first high courtme a lot of questions, but they were very supportive and soon accepted that I am living with it. However, they were not comfortable with the fact that I wanted to go public about my status. They feared that I would suffer from the stigmatisation surrounding living with the disease, but I told them nothing is going to stop me,” she said.
Mbheki says she didn’t want young girls to go through the same things that she had experienced. She wanted to encourage them to learn as much as they could about HIV and how to protect  themselves. She also wanted to help those who were HIV-positive to accept it.
A local non-profit organisation (NPO) called We Care approached her after her first few public motivational talks about living with HIV .
This gave her a platform to reach bigger audiences. She held public engagement sessions in churches and schools in her area. This encouraged many young people to test for HIV or disclose their status.
“I could not believe the feedback I was getting because I thought people would be harsh and judgemental, but they were not, although they were shocked to learn about my story,” she said.
Mbheki said she thought she would struggle to be in a romantic relationship but she needn’t have worried. Of all the people with whom she had relationships only one person was HIV-positive, the person who infected her.
Today she has a three-yearold  HIV-negative child.
“When I was ready to have a child, I spoke to my partner who knows about my status and is HIV-negative and we went on to have a child,” she said.
Mbheki is the adherence counsellor at Nozuko Local Clinic in Butterworth. Her job is to assist people who find it difficult to commit to taking their HIV medication .
Curbing new infections Besides advocating safe sex and encouraging HIV-positive people to get treatment, the National Department of Health supplies pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to select clinics to help prevent highrisk HIV-negative people from contracting the disease.During the 9th South African Aids Conference held earlier this year, Deputy President David Mabuza said according to research, by the University of Cape Town approximately 7.4 million South Africans are HIV positive. Of these, about 4.9 million are on treatment.
Government aims to increase this number by another two million people by December 2020. vSOME OF THE DUTIES of the new Mpumalanga High Court will be to hear appeals from people or organisations that are not happy with a Magistrates' Court decision.
