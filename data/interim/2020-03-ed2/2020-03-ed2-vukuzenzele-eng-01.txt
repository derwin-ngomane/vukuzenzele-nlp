 2 Vuk’uzenzele GENERAL March 2020 Edition 2Dale HesSouth Africa’s first all-female firefight-ing team, made up of women from disad-vantaged backgrounds, is already standing shoul-der-to-shoulder with other firefighters to put out blazes during the Western Cape’s fire season.
Juliet Crew is the end result of the All-Woman Wildland Fire fighting Project, the brainchild of NCC Environmental Services.
Kylie Paul, superintendent of the team, says that she has been proud to witness the growth of the women. “In a very short period of time, the women went from shy and quiet, to proud and confident,” says Paul.
Sharne Maritz (19), a Juliet Crew firefighter, says that being part of the team has given her motivation for the future.
“In my community, we deal with a lot of gang violence, teen -age pregnancy, youth unemploy ment and a high rate of poverty. Being part of this team has not only taken me away from my daily life, it has given me more drive for my future, she says.”With 30 years of experience in wildfire management Dean Ferreira, the managing director of NCC Environmental Services says he has always wanted to of fer women firefighters specialist training and their own quarters so that they could build self-belief  in their capabilities and shatter the glass ceiling created by male firefighters.
In partnership with Chrysalis Academy, a youth development organisation formed by the Western Cape Provincial Government, NCC opened applications for a firefighting programme for at-risk females between the ages of 18 and 25. A team of 15 candidates were selected to become part of the Juliet Crew.
Over 90 percent of crew mem bers come from female-headed households in Phillipi, Retreat, Mfuleni, Khayelitsha, Capricorn Park and Macassar, all of which have a legacy of poverty and violence.
The team recently took part in its first major operation when they helped battle a blaze in Noordhoek.
Charl Steenkamp, brand man ager for NCC, says that the team performed exceptionally well.
“I witnessed them arriving on the scene, fully geared up and ready. They were immediately deployed and began operations with efficiency. This was their first time in a major operation, with helicopters flying and dumping water all around us and major burning happening not far from them." Steenkamp says the Crew Juliet performed exception ally and handled the pressures well, following the lead of their superintendent carefully.

Dale HesSouth African high school learners re cently won the 5th International School Moot Court Competition in Gdy nia, Poland, for the fourth time since 2014.
The competition affords learners an opportunity to understand how the Consti-tution and the law work.
Team South Africa consisted of Okhela Sigwela and Lizal-ise Dlomo, from Hudson Park High School in East London; Mihlali Stofile and Ondele Bede, from Holy Cross High School in Mthatha, Eastern Cape; Sureshka Naidoo and Caitlin Schwarer, from Eden College in Durban; and Non-dumiso Ntshangase and No-sipho Dube from Mathubesi-zwe High School in Mandeni, KwaZulu-Natal.
Congratulating the team, President Cyril Ramaphosa said the victory is an achieve-ment for all South Africans.
“This victory tells us that our schools are effective in pre-paring young South Africans for life beyond the classroom and beyond the borders of our country. This should inspire all of us to work even harder to secure better education outcomes for all learners,” he said.
Before bagging victory at the international competition, the learners first had to conquer the provincial and national legs of the competition by presenting for and against arguments in hypothetical scenarios.
“Locally, our arguments were based on a child having hair extensions when he was not allowed to have them at school. We had to argue whether or not the learner’s rights to education and his own beliefs were being vio-lated, because the dreadlocks were for religious purposes,” says Dlomo.At the international competition, the team argued a sce-nario in which a security min-ister from a fictitious country forcibly removed people from their native land. Dlomo says the team had to prove that the minister violated the people’s rights.
Sigwela says the competition helped sharpen her arguing skills and ability to critically analyse situations, and that the competition is a great opportunity for those looking to grow their skills.
“This competition is not only a platform for people who have an interest in law as a career, but also for any person who wants to improve them-selves because it includes crit-ical and analytical skills.”
