She said on average, NSFAS received more than 3 200 applications a day over the period from September to December, with the number reaching as high as 30 000 on one of the days.
Out of all the applications, 63 percent were females while males made up 37 percent of the applications.
A total of 34 413 applications were received from social grant beneficiaries. Students who are beneficiaries of the South Africa Social Security Agency (SASSA) grant, au tomatically qualify in terms of the financial qualification criteria and will be funded if admitted and registered at a TVET college or university.
“However, it is a concern that only 24 percent of the ap plications are from learners who wish to enrol at TVET colleges, with the balance of 88 percent being applications for universities,” the Minis ter said.
Pandor said of all the appli cations, the highest number, 95 523, was received from the KwaZulu-Natal province.
The number represents 45 percent of the total number of learners that wrote their National Senior Certificate in the province, while the lowest number was from the Northern Cape with 2 573 applications.
She said the success of the current application process can be attributed to a num ber of factors – including the revised and easy-tocomplete online application system, which allowed applicants to complete an application within five min utes; the simplicity of the on-line and manual form with fewer fields to fill; and the accessibility of NSFAS where applicants have been able to apply at the Na tional Youth Development Agency (NYDA) as a result of the scheme’s long-stand ing partnership with the  agency.

January 2019 EditionAt the start of the year, excited pupils from around the country begin their first day of the school year. However, there are many who can’t share in the excitement because par ents register their children late and are then turned away by schools that are full.
The work in placing chil dren at schools for 2019 has already been completed. De partment of Basic Education spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said parents always need to apply for placements the year before their children are due to start school.
“Parents should apply for placements in the first term, with the last day for applica tions usually being the end of the term. The admission process begins at the start of the second term in April and extends to the end of August.
Each year, the placement of learners for the following year should be finalised between October and November.” It is also important for parents to apply to several schools, to increase the chanc es of their children being placed.
“Parents also need to check the registration deadlines of their provinces, as these may differ slightly from other provinces,” Mhlanga advises.
He added that the South African Constitution states that all children between the ages of 7 and 15 need to attend school, which places a responsibility on the de partment to ensure that all learners are enrolled.
Mhlanga said that parents of children who haven’t been placed should urgently contact their provincial and district education offices.
“Parents are encouraged to contact district offices for as sistance in placing learners. It allows them to register learn ers at other schools within the district that have enough space to accommodate learn ers.” There are currently more than 70 district offices in all nine provinces.Documents needed when making an application for your child include:
• Birth certificate• Immunisation card• Transfer card or last school report card for learners who have been to school previ ously.
For further assistance, par ents can contact their pro vincial learner admissions coordinators. vTel: (+27) 12 473 0089 E-mail: vukuzenzele@gcis.gov.zaAddress: Private Bag X745,  Pretoria, 0001Head of Editorial and Production  Tasneem Carrim  |  tasneem@gcis.gov.zaEditor-in-ChiefRoze Moodley | roze@gcis.gov.zaManaging EditorOngezwa Mogotsi ongezwa@gcis.gov.zaNews Editor Noluthando MotswaiWriters  More MatshedisoJauhara KhanSenior Designer Tendai Gonese Language Practitioners  Nomgcibelo Motha  Boitumelo PhalatsePhakamani Dadlanais published by Government Communications (GCIS)Vuk’uzenzeleAll rights reserved.
