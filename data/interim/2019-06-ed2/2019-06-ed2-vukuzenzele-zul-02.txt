“I was researching careers in maths and science and saw a SAAF advert, outlining the requirements to be a pilot or navigator. I realised that I could potentially have a ca reer in aviation and was so excited that I couldn’t sleep,” said Major Mfeka, who is now 29 years old.
Straight after graduat ing from high school, she joined the air force in 2008 as an airman. She officially achieved her SAAF wings in 2011, and progressed quickly through the ranks to become a qualified pilot and then captain. Today, she holds the esteemed rank of major and flies the British-made Hawk Mk120 from the Airforce Base Makhado in Limpopo. Flying above gender and race barriersMajor Mfeka is hum ble about the incredible achievement of being the first female black African fighter jet pilot.
“I know I am representing a lot of people, but I have achieved this because this is the direction I wanted to go. At the SAAF, I have been surrounded by people who are professionals, people who are ambitious and want to be the best, so I wanted to embody that and be an ex pert in my career,” she said.
Major Mfeka added that she hasn’t felt intimidated by the male-dominated na ture of the field.
“I just had to be more asser tive and grow a thicker skin emotionally. But the SAAF strives for professionalism at all times, so they view men and women as equals,” she said, adding that she sometimes outperformed the men in training or  on the academic front.
Career highlights and soaring higherMajor Mfeka has flown jets at some of South Africa’s most prestigious events. A few years after getting her wings, she was tasked with flying at the funeral of former Presi dent Nelson Mandela.
She also fondly remembers being part of a flying forma tion for Freedom Day in Port Elizabeth, which was led by one of her idols.
“The lead plane was flown by Colonel Musa Mbhokota, who was the SAAF’s first black fighter jet pilot. He is somebody I look up to very much and I draw such inspi ration from him, so it was an honour flying in formation with him.”Mfeka’s biggest dream is to become the commander of a Gripen jet, the SAAF’s premier fighter jet.
“When I see myself flying that jet, I get extremely excit ed. I would be so honoured if I could reach that milestone – it would be a dream come true.”Major Mfeka’s message for Youth MonthMajor Mfeka said that the youth should never let their circumstances stand in the way of becoming a success.
“Your dreams and passions are an indication of what you can achieve and what you can become. Your potential is not determined by your background. Some people from very impoverished are as have achieved really great things; they did not let their circumstances dictate to them what their life was going to be like.”
