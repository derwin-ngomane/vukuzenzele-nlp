Distributed by:Printed by:Work hard on your studies from today More Matshediso Learners are advised to approach each day of the school year as if they are writing an examination the next day. This advice comes from the Deputy Minister of Basic Ed ucation, Dr Makgabo Reginah Mhaule, who said in order for learners to achieve desirable marks at the end of the year, they must start taking educa-tion seriously from the beginning of the first quarter.
“It is dangerous for learners to start a year with the attitude that there is still a lot of time for them to study because the year has just begun. They must start studying as if they are preparing for final examinations,” she said.
Her message was directed to learners in all grades, not  only Grade 12.
“ A ll the grades must be taken seriously because you start building up from Grade R to Grade 12,” the Deputy Minister said.
When it comes to teachers, she said it is important that they cover all aspects of the curriculum. The Deputy Minister said it is important for both teachers and learners to be tolerant of each other because the gener ation gap can sometimes cause conflicts.
She called on parents to support their children in their studies and to create a conducive environment for learning.
“Parents must support teachers. We cannot leave our children with teachers and when we are called to attend meetings at school, we do not attend. It is a parent’s responsibility to attend all school events that involve them in order to know who the teachers are and to get information about their children’s behaviour at school,” she said.
The class of 2020She had a special message for the matric class of 2020.
“ A cknowledge the 11 years that you have travelled to get to Grade 12. Do not let all the work that you have done over the years go to waste. The class of 2019 has set the bar high.
Raise the bar. Do not lower the standard,” she said.
She encouraged learners to form study groups as early as the first term so that they can do well at the end of the year. vClass of 2019In the beginning of the year, President Cyril Ramaphosa congratu lated the class of 2019 on achieving an 81.3 percent matric pass rate, which is the high est since the advent of democracy in 1994.  • Free State 88.4 percent • Gauteng 87.2 percent• North West 86.8 percent• Western Cape 82.3 percent • KwaZulu-Natal 81.3 percent • Mpumalanga 80.3 percent • Eastern Cape and Northern Cape 76.5 percent  • Limpopo 73.2 percent.with  both local and provincial governments; and the private sector.
Quality of teaching and learningUniversities have been re quested not to over-enrol in 2020 to ensure the appropri ate infrastructure and human resources for the number of students in the system, the quality of teaching and learn ing and the sustainability of the university system.
  Nzimande said the coun try’s 26 public universities will provide access to ap proximately 201 042 new entrants wishing to pursue their studies across all gener al, technical and professional fields, including Business and Management, Science, Engineering, Agriculture and Technology, Humanities, Social Sciences, the Arts and Education.
 The Minister explained that all universities were required to consider their enrolments in terms of the fiscal realities and constraints, and to plan realistically, making sure that the enrolment numbers targeted, resulted in the optimum number of new students entering the system for the first time in 2020.
 He added that the universi ties should be fully supported through available infrastruc ture and sufficient qualified lecturers and academics, and within the constraints of the funding available for bursaries for poor and work ing-class students.
 “The enrolment plan pro vides details of the enrolment targets for all fields of study, and specifically for those scarce skills fields that sup port our country’s growth, such as Engineering Sciences, Life and Physical Sciences, Animal and Human Health Sciences, and Teacher Educa tion,” Nzimande said.
 He noted that while the overall number of spaces in the university system for 2020 is 201 041, the universities are expected to enrol a two per cent more of this figure.
 “It is also important to note that the audited data for 2018 shows that of the first-time  intake, 21 percent of students enrolled for certificates, 24 percent for diplomas, and 55 percent for degrees.
 “The certificates would mostly be foundation type higher certificates that stu dents who received bach -elors or diploma passes, but did not get the entry requirements for their pro -gramme of choice, could en ter into,” t he Minister said. 

 SANews.gov.zaProspective students who have applied for spaces in university but have not been able to secure space are en couraged to use of the Central Applications Clearing House (CACH) system for assistance in finding space in the PostSchool Education and Training system.
 The CACH service was devel oped to assist learners who are eligible for higher educa tion studies and have applied for space at a University but is not their first choice  after matric results have been released.
