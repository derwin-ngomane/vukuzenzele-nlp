Distributed by:Printed by:period implement 74 projects worth R580 billion in infrastructure and enterprise development projects,” said the President.
The investment should be able to help government intensify its mission to assist small businesses, especially those headed by the youth and women.
“We have to work together as the community, business and various organisations.
We are committed to creating jobs . We want to build schools and TVET colleges to address the issue of education,” said President Ramaphosa.
High levels of unemploymentHe decried the heightened levels of poverty and unem ployment in Waterberg.
“A lot of people here don’t work. A lot of people in this district are poor and rely on social grants. If it were not for social grants, a lot of people would be hungry.
That’s the profile we saw,” he said.
This was among some of the issues the District Devel opment Model seeks to ad dress. “It is to make sure that says there is one plan for one district with a set budget.
National government will know how much is needed, for example, in Waterberg,” said the President.
With the model already be ing piloted in the OR Tambo District, eThekwini Metro and now the Waterberg District, government will in time assess the programme before rolling it out to the rest of the country.
The District Development Model has been approved by government structures, including Cabinet, to in tegrate service delivery that will be more practical, achievable, implementable, measurable and clearly aligned to the key priorities of government.
The model seeks to change the face of rural and urban landscapes by ensuring complementarity between urban and rural develop ment, with a deliberate emphasis on local econom ic development. It is about putting local government at the centre of the country’s growth and development.
President Ramaphosa said it was encouraging that the model had received support from all sectors of society, including traditional and business leaders.
In meetings with tradition al leaders and businesses in the area, the President said, made it apparent that the water shortages was what required the most urgent attention.
The stakeholders also said they wanted a clinic, a uni versity and to see services and development brought closer to them.
“This can only be done if we work together as busi ness, government [and] tra ditional leaders. Waterberg has great potential. We can focus on mining, yes, but we must also focus on agricul ture and tourism,” he said.
“Waterberg is one of the most scenic areas in the country and we want to take advantage of that.”He added: “Every pro ject will be known by the people so that we can all be held accountable. There will be monitoring... those who do not perform, those who want to steal, will be shown the door. We must implement. It’s a model that says: ‘we must work’.”The President was hopeful that this approach would lead to a reduction in service delivery protests.
“They won’t happen if people know government’s plans so there won’t be a need to vandalise infrastructure.” 

SAnews.gov.za• From page 1 New pill set to strengthen the fight against HIVTHE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH  has introduced a new and more effective medication which is set to have a far-reaching impact on the fight against HIV.
Silusapho NyandaA simple, more affordable and effective HIV medication was recently launched in South Africa by Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize and will be rolledout across the country.
The new medication, known as TLD, is a three-in-one, fixed-dose combination that includes dolutegravir, lamivudine and tenofovir. It works by suppressing the viral load, which is the number of HIV particles in a person’s bloodstream.
According to the Department of Health, the mediation has fewer side effects for people living with HIV . TLD can be used by anyone, regardless of their age, gender, race, CD4 cell count and clinical stage.
The pill is small and easy-to-swallow.
“It is the best medicine that is used anywhere in the world and we are very pleased to be able to provide it to our patients. The new medication has fewer side effects, is more tolerable and decreases the viral load more rapidly,” said Mkhize at the launch, held in the Ugu district on KwaZulu-Natal’s south coast, which has one of the highest HIV infection rates in South Africa.
Ugu has attained the United Nations AIDS-set 90-90-90 target, which specifies that by 2020, 90 percent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status; 90 percent of people diagnosed with HIV infection will be on treatment and 90 percent of people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression.
“This is a huge achievement in a district and province with the highest rate of HIV in the country,” Mkhize said.
The pill’s known side effects include nausea, insomnia or occasional dizziness, but these are mild and manageable.
When children become mothersAnother health concern highlighted by the Minister at the launch was teenage pregnancies. “We have too many unwanted and unintended pregnancies in our country as well as too many teenage pregnancies.”He said in the Ugu district alone, 66 girls between the ages of 10 and 14 and 2 436 between the ages of 15 and 19 gave birth in 2018.
“We need to attend to this urgently as children should be children and not parents,” he said. v
