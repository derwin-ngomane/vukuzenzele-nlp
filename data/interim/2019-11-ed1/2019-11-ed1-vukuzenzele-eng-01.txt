• From page 1 Khumbu Shelem be’s had an in teresting journey from punching the till at a Durban Caltex station to owning an operation that sells almost 10,000 litres of fuel a day.
Having started out as a cashier at the Mobeni service station in Durban in 2007, Shelembe, now 36-yearsold, got her first promotion after only six months in book-keeping and supply chain.
She completed Caltex Re tailer Courses in 2011 and 2016 and the previous owner of the Mobeni service station then gave her the opportuni ty to buy a 30 percent share in the business in February 2017.
Later that year, the oppor tunity arose for her to own the station outright.
After an interview with Astron Energy, which owns the Caltex license, special funding was made avail able to Shelembe and she took complete control of the business.
 Astron Energy is now funding the building of Fresh Stop at her site.
“It’s like living a dream,” Shelembe said. “When I think of the way I grew up, I never thought that one day I would be blessed like this.” Hailing from Mtwalume on the S outh Coast of Kwa Zulu-Natal, she funded her studies through bursaries earned from her father’s place of work. She received a National Diploma in Mar keting Management from the Mangosuthu University of Technology in 2004.
 Reflecting on her jour ney, Shelembe tells of her appreciation for those who helped her along the way.
“The people I worked with are very good people. They helped me step by step and now I employ other people and I’m happy because I can employ those who are struggling,” she said.
 With 13 people working at her service station, Shelem be is focused on growth, support and incentivising excellent customer service.
“We motivate each other and share ideas. I also offer incentives for top per forming customer service attendants, based on their sales and customer service.”Aside from her incentive scheme, Shelembe makes sure her team is cared for, ensuring they practice good work-life-balance and spend enough time with their families.
 Her caring approach to her staff, along with her focus on customer service means that Shelembe service station is always pumping.
“On busy days we are doing nearly 10 000 litres of diesel and 5 000 litres of petrol per day. We have a huge site and we cater for trucks and small cars alike.” Astron Energy General Manager Retail Price Njok weni believes Shelembe is a role model for successful transformation and uplift ment in the petrol retail industry.
“We have funding mech anisms and support pro grammes in place for exact ly this type of entrepreneur.
She has ta ken every oppor tunity to advance herself and her business.” Shelembe said she is com mitted to even more growth and development.
“I have to be strong and make Africa proud of me,” she said.  vdress, President Ramaphosa said special economic zones, such as the Dube Trade Port, are important instruments and mediums of attracting foreign investment as well as domestic investment. The SEZs, he said, are also important in building targeted industrial capabilities and establishing new industrial hubs.
“Studies reveal that sea port cities grow faster than inland port cities due to their strategic locations. Durban is especially well positioned but we actually add to that positioning by having that special SEZ. This in itself is a very good foundation to catapult our country to higher levels of growth,” he said.
He praised Thakkar for being a patriotic African.“He is clear, he’s articulate, he’s a visionary and knows exactly what he wants to achieve,” he said.
SA ready and open for investmentThakkar thanked President Ramaphosa and the South African government for pushing the company deliver on its undertaking.
“We have come to South Africa much, much sooner than we have initially planned. We did this because of your vision of making South Africa shine again as a true investment destination and creating real jobs for our youth. It is truly working and we are proof of that,” he said.
As an African investor with investment in 25 African countries, he said venturing into South Africa has been a phenomenal experience.
“It really does show that South Africa is ready and open for investment and for business. More boldness and vision encouraged us to do this and will hopefully contribute to your fourth industrial revolution ambition as well.
Confidence in SAKwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala thanked Mara Phone for showing confidence in KwaZulu-Natal and South Africa.
“The people of [KZN] are pro foundly grateful and honoured to make history and open the first South African cellphone production plant,” he said.
Zikalala praised President Ramaphosa for what he de scribed as tireless efforts and strides in promoting investment in South Africa.
“We are all aware of the efforts of the President to ensure that we attract investment and address the plight of South Africans who are unemployed and go to bed on empty stomachs.
We hope this launch will go far in strengthening your resolve to continue championing our government’s cause of reducing unemployment, inequality and poverty,” he said.
Changing the narrativeTrade and Industry Minister Ebrahim Patel said it is good to see  Africa changing the narrative of being a consumer of goods it does not produce.
“We are changing that sto ryline with cars, with fibre optic cables, with television monitors, with food and now with smartphones … It is good to see this,” he said.
He said today’s launch was critical in cementing KZN as a centre of advanced manufac turing.
“The KZN manufacturing sector employs 350 000 people and it’s the sixth largest manu facturing sector in the African economy. The implementation of the SEZ programme at the Dube Trade Port supported this growth in manufacturing.
“If you walk around you will see fibre optic cables being made, television monitors being assembled … you see examples of manufacturi ng in South Africa. From this example and what we’ve done here and other examples in the country. We are moving forward,” said Patel. –  SAnews.gov.za v2

Unexpected load-shed ding disrupts the lives of millions of people in their homes, work places and businesses.
The cost to our economy of power outages is significant. It contributes to investor unease at a time when we are trying to attract more domestic and for eign capital to South Africa and to improve our global rankings on ease of doing business. It is also understandable that South Africans become frustrated and angry.
 The latest round of load-shedding makes even clearer the ur gency with which we must act to protect our energy supply.
 While technicians are working around the clock to fix problems at several power stations and restore the grid to stability, government last week released the updated Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). It is our policy blueprint for the country’s industrial, commercial and household energy needs until 2030. It provides clarity and certainty on a crucial part of our development path.
 The plan focuses on affordable electricity, reduced emissions and water consumption and a diversity of generation sources. Significantly, given the events of the last week, the updated IRP takes into account the constraints facing Eskom, and deals with the desire by electricity users to have alter natives to meet their energy requirements.
 The IRP supports a diversified energy mix that includes coal, natural gas, renewable energy, battery storage and nuclear power. Because coal remains the dominant energy source for our country, we will be focusing on attracting in-vestment in high efficiency low emissions coal technologies.
South Africa has to reduce its carbon emissions in line with our commitments at the climate change conference held in Paris in 2015. Many other nations have made commitments to reduce their own carbon emissions.
 The IRP envisages a move towards steadily reducing emissions  through a greater uptake of renewables. Alongside this, we need to implement a ‘just transition’ to ensure that communities and workers whose livelihoods depend on the fossil fuel industries are not left behind.
That is why we will be developing a clear framework for the process of decommissioning coal fired power stations that have reached the end of their operational cycle.
The global energy transition will present challenges for communities and workers in the areas where fossil fuel pow-ered energy generation takes place. However it also presents opportunities for those affected to have access to technologies that are more cost-effective and better for human health. It also presents significant investment opportunities in cleaner ener gies.
For example, the recent natural gas find in the Outeniqua Basin off the Southern Cape Coast gives great hope for future discoveries of coastal gas, including recoverable shale.
Opportunities also exist in the fields of biomass, biogas and cogeneration.
While the IRP spells out our long-term plans, we must address our immediate and most pressing challenge to get the lights back on and keep them on. This means we need to get the utility back on sound financial and operational footing.
Though there has been progress in implementing its ninepoint plan, Eskom’s financial position remains untenable and its current operational model difficult.
We will soon be announcing the appointment of a permanent Eskom CEO who, together with a strengthened board, will be  tasked with turning the entity around. They will be guided by the path set out in the special paper on Eskom, which will be released shortly.
The restructuring of Eskom into three entities – generation, transmission and distribution – is critical if we are to respond effectively to the evolving tech nologies and developments in the global energy industry. Es kom needs improve its credit rating so that it can raise fund ing for both its operational and capital expenditure.
The sheer scale of Eskom’s debt is daunting. Further bail outs are putting pressure on an already constrained fiscus. As government has made clear, the most recent support to Es kom comes with stringent con ditions. Fruitless and wasteful expenditure must be stopped.
We also must attend to the debt owed to Eskom with urgency. Currently, Eskom is owed in excess of R23.5 billion by defaulting municipalities, and this continues to increase.
This municipal debt and that from national government de partments must be recovered.
Eskom is also owed huge amounts of money by indi vidual users. This is the time for a frank discussion on the payment of owed money to Eskom by individual users.
The culture of non-payment exists in several parts of the country. Boycotting payment for services had a place in apartheid South Africa. It was an effective tool to mobilise communities against an unjust system. But it has no place in present day South Africa. If public utilities like Eskom are to survive, then all users need to pay for the services they receive.
As government, we will continue to do all within our means to restore the viability of Eskom. Tough decisions will have to be made. There will have to be trade-offs. All sectors of society, especially government, business and labour, must work together to bring this crisis to an end.
Our citizens deserve to be able to cond uct their lives, go to school and operate their businesses confident that they will not be plunged into darkness without warning. At the same time, as citizens, we must understand that when we do not pay, we are part of the problem.
In trying to improve our own standards of living and those of our communities we all have a contribution to make. Our collective future depends on it.  vVuk’uzenzeleFROM THE UNION BUILDINGSTogether we move South Africa forward#SendMe
