“He drowned just after four and his body was only recovered around nine in the evening,” she said. The mother said Thapelo’s 14-year-old brother, who was play ing nearby, had tried to rescue him but could not locate him in the muddy water.
Tambani said she still thinks of Thapelo and his role in the home. “You miss a person’s actions when they are gone. I still think of how he would make food around the house and help his sib lings with chores,” she said, adding that he was her last born child.
