VAT - the poor to be buffered

Government is ensuring that it protects the country’s most vulnerable during these tough economic times.

The effect of an increase in VAT to 15 percent from 14 percent is going to be buffered by South Africa's high level of social services. That's according to Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba who says the increase, which takes effect on 1 April, will also see South Africans enjoy greater relief from below inflation increases in personal income tax rebates and brackets, and steps government is taking towards free higher education. From 1 April 2018 old age disability grants will increase from R1 600 to R1 690 and to R1 700 in October. Child support grants will increase from R380 to R400 in April, and to R410 in October. This is a 6.6 percent annual increase. Since October 2017’s Medium-Term Budget an additional R2.6 billion has been added to social grants to enable these increases. “As highlighted by the President in the State of the Nation Address, government will ensure that social grants will continue to be paid without disruption,” said Minister Gigaba. In its budget review, National Treasury said expenditure on social protection provides social security and a safety net for low-income South Africans. It also improves social welfare service delivery to vulnerable individuals through policy and legislative reform, growing the number of social workers, improving access to Early Childhood Development and facilitating food and nutrition initiatives. “Spending on social protection is set to rise from R193.4 billion in 2018/19 to R223.9 billion by 2020/21, growing by an average of 7.9 percent. The number of social grant beneficiaries is expected to reach 18.1 million by the end of 2020/21.” An estimated 12.8 million people will receive the child support grant and 3.7 million people will receive the old-age grant.

A new Randfontein for residents
Job opportunities in the pipeline for Randfontein residents.

The Rand West City Local Municipality is changing the face of Randfontein through the Mantrose Mega City Project, which will see thousands of houses being built for locals and will bring various job oppor-tunities to communitymembers. The recently launched R11 billion project includes the building of a mall, clinic, railway line and other amenities in Middelvlei, which will ensure job creation and boost investor confidence in the area. Rand West City Local Municipality spokesperson Tshidiso Tlharipe said the project will change the face of Randfontein. “We are truly excited about this project and we know that it is going to bring about positive change for our people. “Not only are we going to build 15 000 houses, we will also provide thousands of job opportunities for our locals and that’s ultimately what we want. We want to absorb them in projects in their own town and we believe that this will uplift them as individuals,” he said. The houses will consist of RDP and low-cost units. “We have many business owners who will sub-contract in the development of this project, and locals who will do general work, such as brick laying, plastering and painting,” said Tlharipe. This will go a long way towards accommodating the less fortunate and those who earn between R3 000 and R15 000 per month. The owner and chairperson of Finsbury Middelvlei Consortium, Matshidiso Ngakane, said the project will give them an opportunity to be part of something big in their own communities. “This is the first project of its kind in Randfontein and we are thrilled as residents. The project will pro-vide much-needed job opportunities for locals for at least seven years and will see business owners able to sustain themselves as well,” said Ngakane.
